Haunted Hill Font Set by Chad Savage
https://www.sinisterfonts.com

Created 2024, hand-lettered. I was watching the extras on my DVD copy of 1959's classic "House on Haunted Hill" and was struck by the lettering used for the movie title. I've never seen it anywhere else - just that one trailer. So I had to turn it into a font! I wasn't concerned with it being letter-perfect so much as capturing the look-and-feel. Then I did a couple of variants just for funsies!

This is a free font, and I mean FREE. Use it however you want, for whatever you want, for personal and commercial purposes (you do NOT need to email me and ask permission - this is that!). If you make something cool with it, I'd love to see it - email me at savage@sinister.me and tell me about it. If you offer it for download on your own font site, PLEASE include this Read Me. That's not too much to ask, is it?

This font is intended for specialty and graphic uses. It will look just awful if used in a paragraph format.
